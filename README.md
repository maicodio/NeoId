# NeoId
Simple Sequential Guids Generation

This project is based on [MassTransit.NewId](https://masstransit.io/documentation/patterns/newid) ([Source code](https://github.com/phatboyg/NewId))

I created this project because I had trouble explaining my collegaes that these Guids are different (Generated by `MassTransit.NewId.NextSequentialGuid`):

- 08dbb5e4-80be-c4c0-0a58-a9feac020000
- 08dbb5e4-80be-c7d5-0a58-a9feac020000


So i decided to make a more human readable sequential Guids, like these:

- 08dc0862-f1da-27f0-0102-03040019d6f6
- 08dc0862-f1da-2803-0102-0304001a45fc

The last bytes of the Id is random data, being easier to see the difference.

## Install

```bash
dotnet add package DbRewinder
```

## Usage

```csharp
Guid id = NeoIdConfiguration.DefaultConfiguration.Provider.CreateNew();
```
